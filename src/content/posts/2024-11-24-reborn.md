```
An old song plays, a whisper of yore,
A love once vibrant, now no more.
A chapter closed, a tale of pain,
A stormy end, a cleansing rain.

The world seemed dim, the night too long,
Heartbeats echoed a broken song.
Fear and doubt, a shadowed refrain,
Lost in the silence, swallowed by pain.

But dawn arose, and so did I,
A phoenix soaring through the sky.
The mirror cracked to show anew,
A world that's mine to shape, to view.

No longer chained by pre-set molds,
I hold the pen, my story unfolds.
The world’s a playground, vast and free,
No limits now, just endless me.

Through storms, we find what life can be,
Born again, unbound, and free.
Setbacks, trials—they break, they wake,
A life reclaimed, for us to make.
