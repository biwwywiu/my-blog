```
Burlingame whispers in autumn's soft rain,
Leaves swirl like dancers, a golden refrain.
The air sings of coffee, of laughter, of bread,
Life feels a movie, each scene joyfully led.

With Camille, Elias, and Nebo in stride,
A morning of sun, where the heart opens wide.
Gratitude hums in the rustle of trees,
This is the multiverse I'd search on my knees.

Dreams intertwine with the clarity near,
Bliss in the slowness, the moments sincere.
Strength in the stillness, energy anew,
A perfect day, under skies crisp and blue.
