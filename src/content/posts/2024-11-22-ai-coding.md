The Tale of Tokens and Code

I asked my AI to write some code,
A script to lighten my workload.
At first, it clicked—a flawless start!
"This tool," I thought, "is state of the art!"

But soon the wheels began to grind,
The logic broke, the loops misaligned.
"Just one more try," I said with hope,
As tokens vanished like slippery soap.

It spat out errors, each more absurd,
Syntax mangled, logic blurred.
Still, I prodded, tweak by tweak,
But the fix I sought remained oblique.

Token by token, I fed the beast,
Its appetite a never-ending feast.
"One last attempt," I begged the air,
But progress stalled—I pulled my hair.

Then it hit me: the gambler's trap!
This wasn't code, just endless claptrap.
So I paused, stepped back, took a breath,
And stopped this spiral to AI's depths.

For when the tokens start to drain,
And all your tries feel much the same,
It’s time to think, not just demand,
And let your mind, not tools, command.
